        <p class="col-md-4" style="margin-top: 50px">My team and i built this project for a code-a-thon, using
            BetterDoctors API, Ubers API and the Ionic framework. This User friendly, hybrid app
            will take you from wherever it is you decide to get injured, to the hospital of your choice
            with only one a couple simple clicks of a button. Oh and don't worry about calling an
            ambulance and spending $2.000 dollars on a ride, this app will call you a ride in a
            comfortable/clean car with AC and good music, and save you about $1.956 dollars.
            (Hope you enjoy)  </p>
