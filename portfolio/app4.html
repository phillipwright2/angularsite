                the house, an awesome idea came from out of someones mouth. There was twelve days left
                in our journey through Coding House when the bright idea came about to do something
                special that was relevant to both web development and Christmas at the same time.
                12 Apps Of Christmas is what we came up with. Everyone had a different simple idea
                that they wated to turn into a small app that could be done in a day. There are all
                kinds of creative apps in this article.( I hope you find a couple of them useful. )<br>
