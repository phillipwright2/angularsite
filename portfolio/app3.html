                hack-a-thon, the team and I put together a simple, addictive and exciting game which 
                can be played with one hand. Our target users are everyone from children to adults,
                and most importantly puffin enthusiasts. We are proud of the simple and intuitive gameplay.
                Have fun, let me know if it needs to be a little harder to get past. <br>
