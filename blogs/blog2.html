 	THE "NOT SO GOOD" PARTS OF JAVASCRIPT.
 </p>
 <p>
 	Many people do not believe that there are any good aspects of javascript, but let me explain some aspects of javascript before jumping on that bandwagon with these "non-believers." Javascript is the most widely used programming language in the world; there are more javascript processors on more computers than anything other coding languages. It is also the world's most misunderstood programming language ever created. If you have ever tried using it, it is completely normal to experience feelings that may change from confusion into frustration, and maybe even to a little bit of anger from time to time (This is when you remember the coping mechanism reminder: keep calm). As it beholds some of the best (and admittedly worst ) ideas ever inserted into a programming language, there are many factors that are useful. This language can accommodate a plethora of programmers at different stages of learning, from people that don’t really know what they’re doing so they just cut and paste until their code works, to computer scientist that uses javascript as a foundation for his web applications and development every single day. On the positive side, though, there is no boundary; the inexperienced coder just can’t be afraid to make mistakes. But that is what coding is all about.
	The experience with programming with javascript in the browser is horrible, I know, but it is important to keep in mind, that it is not the fault of the programming language. Instead it is the DOM (Document Object Module). Luckily there are a lot of variations of ajax modules out there that help to fix this catastrophe dramatically. Some say that javascript is not fast enough, but if they knew the details, they would know that the problems actually stem from the DOM. If one can see how much time the program is actually running, one will realize that most of the time is spent in the DOM interface, and there is only a fraction of time spent running your program.
	Some of the more problematic parts of javascript include the “Global Variables”. Javascript does not have a linker, so the way compilation variables are bound together is that they are tossed into a common global namespace in which all the variable names can collide and interfere with each other. Javascript has terrible problems with reliability and even worse issues with security. The plus sign (+) is another problem beginners will encounter because it has the ability to add and concatenating strings, which is an overload from Java. This is very strongly typed and gives you the ability to predict what your code is going to do, but in Javascript you cannot make these same predictions. The next thing i want to talk about is semicolons, which can be hard to understand exactly where to put them in your code. This is not a huge problem, because javascript pretty much tells the programmer that its going to put them in the code for the programmer. It may not always put the semicolons in the right place, though, which can be very frustrating indeed. The best recommendation is that one learn the syntax from the word "go" and learn exactly where they go. Another scary feature of javascript is the type of attribute which allows you to determine if the object is a string or number. This is difficult because no matter what you ask about an object it just says that it is an object. I know these things all seem like irritating, non helpful features, and I would like to tell you that, yes, they are, and we’ll explore this subject further in the next blog.
