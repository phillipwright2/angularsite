		Saturday morning, as the team and I rose with the sun, we knew not what lay ahead of us. We drove deep into the Redwood forest, ready to track up and down hills and uncharted lands as a team with our hands full of features for our air-soft (hard) guns to cause nothing less than chaos and confusion. It wasn't until that trek into the woods, that I realized just how fun this adventure was going to be, when we witnessed three deer, a mountain lion, the combination of the two (not good), and we also got to see an old redwood tree take a plunge to its final resting place. Then we got out of the truck.
As we marched deeper into these beasts known as the Redwoods, the only thing I could keep thinking about was how small we as people really are in this giant world. We split the teams up as evenly as we could and got started with the madness. From when the starting pistol went off until the end, we were running stealthily, jumping over wooded terrain, diving for coverage, and shooting folks on the other team as best we could. It was like a scene out of Black Ops the video game. Every chance I got, I dove in the bushes trying to escape the wrath that was upon me. Ultimately, I ended up getting shot in the head at least three times: one from close range and the other two which felt closer than they actually were.
WAfter the madness had concluded, we sat around a "city camp fire," in other words a head lamp under a cup, and shared stories that we had lived through and a few more ghost tales we had also acquired over the years. I was surprised at how we, people at a crossroads with so many different histories and paths, ended up bonding like no other relationship I had experienced yet this lifetime, strengthening our capacity as a team. After the story time ended, our group slept on the bare ground, with the purpose of learning the meaning of perseverance , the hard way. I woke up at about 4:00 a.m., checked my phone and realized the temperature had dropped to forty-seven degrees. As I scanned the campsite, I noticed I wasn't the only one shaking like a leaf in the frigid air. I have never been that cold for that long. Finally, when everyone else started getting up and around, it was close to 7:00 a.m. There was a shaking contest for nearly twenty minutes amongst us all, only alleviated by when we cleaned up the campsite. As we had a small yet delicious breakfast, and then packed the equipment in the truck, I couldn't help thinking what a valuable learning experience this was. It taught us much about working as a team and blocking out adversity, or at least using it to an advantage. Moving forward, I would do it again with the same group of characters, any day of the week, though, after reflection, I believe we can pack sleeping bags this time, have a real fire, and maybe tote along a tent or two.
